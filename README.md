In this challenge we were asked to do a Precipitation Analysis and a Station Analysis for the state of Hawaii. 

In the precipitation analysis we were asked to find the most recent date in the dataset which was 2017-08-23. Then I performed a query to gather data and precipitation scores greater than or equal to one year from the most recent date (2017-08-23). Then I created a dataframe with this information and created columns for Date and Precipitation. I then sorted this by the date and created a graph to display the data. 

The graph is below:
