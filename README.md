# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge we were asked to do a Precipitation Analysis and a Station Analysis for the state of Hawaii. 

In the precipitation analysis we were asked to find the most recent date in the dataset which was 2017-08-23. Then I performed a query to gather data and precipitation scores greater than or equal to one year from the most recent date (2017-08-23).
